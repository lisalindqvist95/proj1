 ### Possible Features to Implement

- __Photo Gallery__
  
  - A feature that could be implemented on the site is a photo gallery from the latest shows for old fans of the band to look through and for new fans to get a feeling of the band and what they might expect from a concert. To compensate for this not existing on the current site the background images contains pictures of the band instead. 
  
- __New music__ 
  
  - Another feature that should be a part of the page is new music, possibly with new music videos.

- __News__
 
  - There could also be a news section about what the band is currently doing, for the people who don’t want to subscribe to the newsletter but still want ongoing information about the band.

- __Navigation__

  - A feature that could improve is the navbar which should stay at the top of the page when the user scrolls down to improve the user experience. It could also be hamburger-menu on smaller screens so that it woulndt take up as much space.
  - The navbar could contain a dropdown menu with direct links to the official site for tickets and merch, in order for the user to get to those sites faster if they want.

## Testing

### Responsiveness

  - The website is responsive to fit different screen sizes. 
  - It has four media queries for different sizes: max width of 1124px, max width of 800px, max width of 500px and max width of 300px. The width was chosen based on standard screen sizes and the size where the layout started to look distorted. 
  - The responsiveness was tested using DevTools.
  - The text and images will resize depending on the size of the screen so that the user will be able to read the text and see the pictures regardless of the device they’re on. 
  - Since units like vw and % are used in the code to improve responsiveness there was an issue with text and images becoming too small och smaller screens. This was fixed by changing the size in the media queries. 

### Browser Testing

  - The website is tested on the commonly used browsers: Chrome, Safari, Edge, Firefox and Opera. 
  - There was a problem in Firefox where the placeholder text in the form-field wouldn't show. This was fixed by changing the color in the CSS-file. 
  - In Safari there was an issue with the google fonts that would not load. This was fixed by adding the font-weight and font-family to the textelement in the CSS-file.

- __Possible bugs__
  - There could be possible bugs in browsers that have not been tested, specifically older browsers like Internet Explorer, for example [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/tryit.php?filename=trycss3_align-items) notes that Internet Explorer 10 and earlier versions does not support the proberty of "align-items". Older versions of browsers are not as commonly used, Internet Explorer 10 is also discontinued, so this would not cause issues for the majority of users of the site.
